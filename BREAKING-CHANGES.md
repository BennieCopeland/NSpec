# Breaking Changes

## NSpec 2.0.0

Removed support for .NET Framework 4.5. Minimum required version is now .NET 4.5.2.

### Reason

In order to have a single .NET Core project targeting both .NET Core and .NET Frameowrk.

### Workaround

Remain on NSpec 1.0.13 if you need to support .NET Framework 4.5 or 4.5.1.
