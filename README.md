# NSpec

NSpec is a BDD framework for .NET of the xSpec (context/specification) flavor. NSpec is intended to be used to drive development through specifying behavior at the unit level. NSpec is heavily inspired by RSpec and built upon the NUnit assertion library.

NSpec is written by [Matt Florence](http://twitter.com/mattflo) and [Amir Rajan](http://twitter.com/amirrajan). It's shaped and benefited by hard work from our [contributors](https://github.com/nspec/NSpec/contributors).
