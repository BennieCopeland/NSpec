      <p> I'm currently a Senior Consultant at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com/">Improving Enterprises</a> in Dallas, Texas. Improving has afforded me the opportunity to work alongside some of the brightest minds in the field.  </p>
      <p> I believe there is incredible value in driving development through specifying behavior. I've been writing BDD style tests in NUnit and MSTest for the past few years and despite the advantages it has always felt somewhat awkward. When I had the opportunity to dive deeper into ruby with fellow Improvinger, Greg Vaughn, I thoroughly enjoyed RSpec. That's what led me to create NSpec.  </p>
      <p> I believe strongly in concepts such as inherent simplicity, agility, self-organizing groups, empowerment, lean, code kata, and practice, practice, practice. Besides hacking code, I cherish spending time with my family and enjoy long runs through the woods. Follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/mattflo">http://twitter.com/mattflo</a>.  </p>

      <p> Can't agree with Matt more. <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com/">Improving Enterprises</a> has allowed me to get out of my echo chamber and get a chance to work side by side with incredibly talented individuals. Working with Matt on NSpec has been a truly humbling experience.  </p>
      <p> I can't stress enough how important it is for developers to try different programming languages. Working with Ruby, RSpec and ZenTest has been inspiring. We're hoping that NSpec and SpecWatchr bring the benefits of BDD (the Context/Specification style) to .Net. I don't entirely remember what conversations got Matt hacking on NSpec, but I'm sure the "you can do that in ruby" heckling from Greg Vaughn got us going to some extent.  </p>
      <p> Passion and continuous improvement are absolutely necessary to ensure that the craft of software development continues to evolve. Follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/amirrajan">http://twitter.com/amirrajan</a>.  </p>
